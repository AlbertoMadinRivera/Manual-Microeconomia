# MICROECONOMICS WHIT `R`: USING `GGPLOT2` PACKAGE

This is a manual that I am creating little by little on microeconomics in {`R`} through the {`ggplot2`} library.

This is a manual that I am going to create on microeconomics in {`R`}. Where objects and variables that are created
are used to model the different topics that show and describe neoclassical theory. 
I try to do this little by little with the {`ggplot2`} library, so that it is displayed 
in an aesthetic and presentable way in {`RMarkdown`} projects. If you want a suggestion 
regarding the code change, you can tell me, even to include other topics or to 
continue inspiring new ones. Thank you. :D
